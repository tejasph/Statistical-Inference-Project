##Part 1: The Questions

By investigating the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials, where lambda is 0.2 and both the mean and standard deviation are 5, answer the following questions:

1. Show the sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
2. Show how variable the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
3. Show that the distribution is approximately normal.
